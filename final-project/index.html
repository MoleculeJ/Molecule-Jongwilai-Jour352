                <b>Story by Sophia da Silva</b><br /><b>Data and Web Design by Molecule Jongwilai</b><br />Published Dec
                5, 2024
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>WASHINGTON</b> - A <b>researcher</b> at the University of Maryland lost her job last summer. She’s
                from Colombia and was here on a <b>student</b> visa extension and not having a job means she’ll have to
                go back.
            </p>
            <p>
                Her lab lost federal funding earlier this year and couldn’t afford to keep her on. No longer being
                associated with the university, she was left without housing, without health insurance and without
                important information from International Student and Scholars Services. 
            </p>
            <p>
                “The issue here with these funding cuts is, it's not only that your research is done, it's that your
                immigration status is also affected,” she told Capital News Service.
            </p>
            <p>She asked CNS not to identify her for fear of being targeted.</p>
            <p>
                Her story isn’t unique. This year the Trump administration launched a crackdown on international
                students including

                <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/ICEB-2025-0001-0001" target="_blank">proposed changes</a>
                to F-1 visas threaten to make international students even more vulnerable.
            </p>
            <p>“This is not the U.S. that <b>[it was]</b> when I came here,” she said.</p>
            <p>
                F-1 visas – the visa most students come to the United States under – allows students to stay in the
                United States under  <a href="https://www.nafsa.org/Duration-status-explainer" target="_blank"
                    >“duration of status”</a
                >; visa holders are allowed to stay in the U.S. as long as they are making normal progress on their
                research or academic programs.
            </p>
            <p>
                A new policy, proposed by the Department of Homeland Security in August, would eliminate duration of
                status and give students a maximum of four years before applying for another visa known as an “extension
                of stay.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Imagine doing four years of your degree and then being told, ‘no, you actually have to go back and try
                to reapply for a visa’,” said University of Maryland Graduate Labor Union organizer Rose Ying.
            </p>
            <p>
                Applications for extension of stay visas are costly to students including processing and legal fees and
                subject to backlogs, according to the University of Maryland’s
                <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/ICEB-2025-0001-21530" target="_blank">comment</a> opposing
                the proposal. This is all without guarantee that extension will be granted.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Trump administration argued that its new policy is necessary to counter “student visa abuse”.  The
                University of Maryland said in its comment that getting rid of duration of status only puts more work
                onto U.S. Citizenship and immigration Services, resulting in even more backlogs
            </p>
            <p>
                Universities have already seen a decline in foreign student enrollment as a result of new visa policies.
                The International Trade Administration reported a 19.1% in F-1 arrivals this August.
